						<div class=" termsCondition">
							<h2 class="fontW500 font28 playfair">What we may need from you</h2>
							<p class="font18 fontW300 colorGy">We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right

							<h2 class="fontW500 font28 playfair">Time limit to respond</h2>

							<h2 class="fontW500 font28 playfair">LAWFUL BASIS</h2>
							<p class="font18 fontW300 colorGy">Legitimate Interest means the interest of our business in conducting and managing our business to
enable us to give you the best service/product and the best and most secure experience. We make sure we
consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative) and your rights before we
process your personal data for our legitimate interests. We do not use your personal data for activities
where our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless we have your consent or are otherwise
required or permitted to by law). You can obtain further information about how we assess our legitimate
interests against any potential impact on you in respect of specific activities by contacting us.</p>

							<h2 class="fontW500 font28 playfair">YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS</h2>
							<p class="font18 fontW300 colorGy">You have the right to:</p>
							<p class="font18 fontW300 colorGy">Request access to your personal data (commonly known as a &quot;data subject access request&quot;). This
enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully
processing it.</p>
							<p class="font18 fontW300 colorGy">Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete
or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data
you provide to us.</p>
							<p class="font18 fontW300 colorGy">Request erasure of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data
where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see
below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your
personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your
request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your
request.</p>
							<p class="font18 fontW300 colorGy">Object to processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a
third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to
processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have
the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some
cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which
override your rights and freedoms.</p>
							<p class="font18 fontW300 colorGy">Request restriction of processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the
processing of your personal data in the following scenarios:</p>
							<p class="font18 fontW300 colorGy">If you want us to establish the data&#39;s accuracy.</p>
							<p class="font18 fontW300 colorGy">Where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it.</p>
							<p class="font18 fontW300 colorGy">Where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or
defend legal claims.</p>
							<p class="font18 fontW300 colorGy">You have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate
grounds to use it.</p>
							<p class="font18 fontW300 colorGy">Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party
you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that
this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where
we used the information to perform a contract with you.</p>
							<p class="font18 fontW300 colorGy">Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However,
this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you
withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise
you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.</p>
